                  I am a Computer Science undergrad and have great passion for computers and anything tech. I really enjoy competitive programming, 
                  and try to participate as much as I can (although it is kinda difficult to manage these days). ReactJS is my accomplice and I also enjoy building stuff with AWS Tech.
                  I am a jack of all trades and master in none. Currently I am into Docker and Virtualization, trying to learn some stuff. My primary interests are on Front-end web Development
                  and AWS Techonologies and Data analytics.

                  In my free time, I enjoy participating in Quizzing other Trivia competitions (You know I am something of a Nerd myself ðŸ˜‰).
                  I also like to watch Anime and currently hooked on watching Shingeki no Kyujin and Jojo's bizzare adventure.
                  At my very liesure time, I also write some poems and haikus, I have collected all of my work 
                  <a href="https://gazings.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"> here.</a> (It is going to be embarrasing).
                  Recently, I have started an habit of book reading and currently I am reading "No Mud, No Lotus".
                  Hit me up, if you have anything in common and want to discuss!
